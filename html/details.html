			<p class="question"><strong>What prices to expect?</strong></p>
			<p>Developing a new technology requires a slight investement and the price is heavily dependent on the idea. However, our evaluation process is free! After you pitch your idea, our engineers will quickly respond and report a quota for your idea.</p>

			<p class="question" ><strong>What rights do I have over my idea?</strong></p>
			<p style="margin-bottom: 100px;">You and your company keep intellectual property rights of your idea! You keep the prodcut we create for further development or production. Shokli Studio asks for logo placement on manufactured products and code as well as rights to advertise your product on our website. Finally, if your technology goes onto the market, Shokli Studio requests 5% of all sales up to the first $5,000</p>

		<center><h1>More Frequently Asked Questions</h1></center>
		<p class="question"><strong>What is Shokli Studios?</strong></p>
		<p>Shokli Studios is a modest engineering team that believes that people have many brilliant ideas and potential for technological contributions. Unfortunately, many people do not have the time, man power, or the skills necessary to develop on a spectacular idea. Our team of engineers and computer scientists work to develop your idea, project, or technology.</p>
		<p class="question"><strong>Who will I be working with?</strong></p>
		<p>You will be working along side computer scientists and electrical engineers with years of programming background. Our engineers have a diverse array of experience in both industry and research. Shokli Studios keeps a close relationship with our customers. We provide our customers with contact information of our lead engineers so that you can quickly get in touch if you have any additions to your ideas or just want to discuss plans.</p>
		<p class="question"><strong>How long does it take to develop a project?</strong></p>
		<p>The time for a project is heavily dependent on the project itself. Simple websites can take less than a couple of weeks, while bigger technologies can span months. Shokli Studio engineering work teams divide working periods in yearly quarters and limit projects to a maximum of two quarters before performing progress reports and evaluations.</p>
		<p></p>
		<p class="question"><strong>Can I further develop my product with Shokli Studios?</strong></p>
		<p>Shokli Studios loves to work with returning customers. If customers want to further develop their technology with us, we perform an evaluation of the proposal and return with a new quota.</p>
